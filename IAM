FIM works through this process: 

A user’s login credentials are stored on their own IdP.
The user attempts to log in to a remote application that uses federated identity.
The remote application then requests federated authentication from the user’s authentication server.
Finally, the user’s authentication server authorizes the user and confirms their identity to the application, which grants them access.
