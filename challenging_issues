TERRAFORM:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. With interpolation:
    var.variable-name   - with variable name, just var. can be used.
    ${var.variable-name}-other-text  - with other values, should use interpolation.
    
2. Cycle Error: Error faced when creating the security group.
    For 2 resources, refered each other source_security_group and both are dependant on each other. 
    Solution is separate the security_group and security_group_rule.
    
3. Error when creating instances using for_each with splat expression:
    Splat expression (*) can be used only with LIST. for-each support set or map.
    To overcome this, use locals 
    locals{
    security_groups = { key1 = value2, key2=value2}
    }
    To refer by using, for_each=local,security_groups  and passing each.value to variable. 
    
4. State file is locked and cannot be used by other resource:
    terraform force-unlock ID
    terraform force-unlock --force ID
    ID is found in error message. 
    
5.
